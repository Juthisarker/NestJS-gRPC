NestJS gRPC Microservices - Product and Order Services
This repository is created as a learning project for understanding how to implement gRPC in a NestJS framework. It consists of two microservices:

Product Service
Order Service
Both services communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance, open-source, and universal RPC framework that uses HTTP/2.
